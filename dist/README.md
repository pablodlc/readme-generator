## Description
The deployed application can be seen by clicking this link: [READ-arator!](https://github.com/pablodlc/readme-generator).  
This is a JavaScript powered README generator. Using **Inquirer**, the user goes through a series of prompts in the terminal about the application requiring a README file. If the user chooses to skip a non-required prompt, the finished README will not display any reference to it. However, if the user does include a non-required prompt, this generator will take the user's input as its corresponding section's content with a header, and it will create a link to the section as a list item in the Table of Contents. If the user chooses to not include a license, the generator ignores all references to licenses. But if the user chooses a license, a License section is generated with the header, "License", and a description of the license as its content. Further, if the user chose a license to include, a badge is generated after the Description. Although some of my responses here are copy/paste content in order to make a shorter walkthrough video, this README was completely genereated programatically!
