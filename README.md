## Installation Instructions:

Navigate to the folder on your device where you would like to install **READ-ARATOR**, and clone the repository by entering the following in the root folder: `git clone https://github.com/pablodlc/readme-generator.git`. Open **READ-ARATOR** in your preferred integrated development environment. I use VS Code, so some instructions may not work on all IDEs. Open the integrated terminal, and enter `npm init -y` to initialize a new npm package. After that finishes, enter `npm i` to enter the application's only dependency, Inquirer.js.  


## Usage:

Open the integrated terminal at the root level of the application, then enter the command `node index`. **READ-ARATOR** will initialize in the terminal. Follow the prompts, entering the appropriate information to include in the README. When finished, **READ-ARATOR** will display a message announcing its completion and informing the user the finished README file can be found in the `/dist` folder. The README can then be relocated to its proper location.
